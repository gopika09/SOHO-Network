# SOHO Network Implementation

The Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Network Implementation project aims to design and configure a reliable and efficient network 
infrastructure for a simulated organization. This project focuses on segmenting the network using Virtual LANs (VLANs) to enhance 
performance, security, and management.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Used for simulation and visualization of the network setup.
- **Cisco Routers and Switches**: For configuration and implementation of VLANs, DHCP, and inter-VLAN routing.
- **Subnetting and Networking Protocols**: Knowledge of TCP/IP, VLANs, and DHCP was essential for design and configuration.

## Steps

1. **Network Design**:
    - Define the network architecture based on the organization's needs.
    - Create a subnetting plan to accommodate three distinct departments: Admin, Finance, and Reception.

2. **Subnetting**:
    - Start with the base network of `192.168.1.0/24`.
    - Calculate subnets based on the requirement for three subnets, resulting in a new subnet mask of `255.255.255.192`.

3. **Router Configuration**:
    - Configure subinterfaces on the router to handle different VLANs.
    - Set up DHCP pools for each department to automate IP address assignment.

4. **Switch Configuration**:
    - Configure access ports for each VLAN.
    - Set a trunk port for the router connection to allow traffic from multiple VLANs.

5. **Testing and Verification**:
    - Verify connectivity between devices within the same VLAN.
    - Ensure inter-VLAN communication through the router.

## Conclusion

The SOHO Network Implementation project successfully demonstrated the importance of proper network segmentation and management in a 
small office environment. By utilizing VLANs and effective routing techniques, the project ensured improved security and performance. 
This experience reinforced the understanding of networking concepts and the practical application of Cisco configuration commands, 
providing a solid foundation for future networking endeavors.
